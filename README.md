# OSMeta
OpenStreetMap-Metaverse

This is English, well, kind of, as I am German.

Facebook/Meta announced THE Metaverse - as a place, anyone could join, but takes 50% of any payments There is no attempt to start an FOS Metaverse. This is partly a joke an the idea to make an OSM Metaverse.

The very first step will be to show a 3D Earth, generated by OSM tagging. The first solution to this is, to take the 3D Tiles from OSM2World.

It is done by Rust and (actually) by the grate "bevy", using "wgpu".

bevy is a game engine! A bit odd but it supports what is needed. Aseptically GPU instancing and (really now working) build to web/WASM.

Before, the crates "rend3" and "tree-d" were used. This decision may change any time! :-)
